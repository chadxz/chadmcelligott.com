This is my personal website that I am currently hosting using Amazon S3.  I don't have much time to work on it, but I would like to slowly add content to it and progressively enhance the look and feel as needed.  On the technical side of things, I would like to setup a static site generator such as [Jekyll][] to help me manage the templating, as well as automate the process of uploading changed files to S3 (probably using [s3-website][]).
