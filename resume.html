    <header>Chad McElligott's Resume</header>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>Over 15 years of experience working with computers in various roles. Over 7 years of experience working on production Windows and Web applications. Software engineering is my passion!</p>
    <p>All in all, my goal is to get things done. I understand that developing good software is not only about producing quality code. Often the task may also require clear and eloquent communication among teammates and/or end users, solid writing skills when documentation is needed, filling non-development roles like teaching or providing support, speaking my mind when my work reveals important new information, and so on. I feel that as someone that gets things done, my job isn't simply to write code, but to do whatever is necessary to complete the task at hand efficiently and effectively.</p>
    <p>Moving forward, I hope to continue to build on my current skill set while improving my systems development experience, architecture experience, and applying my skills to new problem domains. I hope to continue to improve my ability to work efficiently in teams, increase my productivity, and continue to stay on top of current trends and technologies to make myself a strong asset to any group I may work with.</p>
